# Instructions
***********************
To run this project, simply import the DB2P3 directory into a Android Studio
project and hit "run app". You will need the latest version of Android, API 25
Android 7.1. You will also need to run our web site on XAMP in a directory
called "Books". This should be inside of the htdocs folder, or where ever
your XAMP / Apache server stores publicly accessible directories.

To find our Java code, as well as our XML files, you need to go to
the following directories:

DB2P3\DB2P3\app\src\main\java\downing\pearce\db2p3 -> Java Code here

DB2P3\DB2P3\app\src\main\res\layout -> Layout XML files here

DB2P3\DB2P3\app\src\main\res\values -> String values here

DB2P3\DB2P3\app\src\main -> Android Manifest here

DB2P3\DB2P3\app -> Build.gradle here

# Notes
***********************
We have implemented Queries 1 to 6 so far. Each query runs our PHP code on
the localhost web server, and then displays the results in Android.

We have also included screenshots of all 6 queries running successfully on our
local machine.
